23/3

Today we assambled the group and got to know eachothers, we discussed our individual skills and what we are aiming to do. We set up our work envionment and did some brainstorming. We managed to decide that we wanted to create a 3D survival game, where the main character is to survive for as long as posible while monsters spawn in waves trying to kill the main character. We also decided that our ups for the game was to transfom an industrial envionment into a natural environment filled with plants and colors.

Today we had another meeting with the group where we divided the workload amongst eachother. We managed to create a 3D model team, Which I am a part of, and a coding/unity team and finaly a concept and GDD management team. We also desided that we should start working for a few hours so that we have something to display for the demo that is due 31/3.

I started to work a little bit whit the 3D modelling, i am supposed to create the main character aswell as the enemies and some of the props of the game. While waiting for my team member to sketch the characters i decided to creat a flower platform where the player will spawn from.
