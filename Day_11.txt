In this session, one of the team members was not happy with the boss. In their opinion “it looked like shit”, which surprisingly made me happy because I felt the same. Then I decided to create a cactus boss instead that would have some real movements. I got some inspiration from the group members and the internet, and this time I decided to create the 3D model from imagination. This was a bad idea since the pictures in the head always look better than when put into reality. But I then decided to use a reference picture that I could look at when modeling the boss. I began by making a simple cactus shape by merging a cylinder and a hemisphere, then I narrowed down the bottom of the cylinder to get a nice cactus shape. Then I deleted some faces on the side of the cylinder to create arms for the boss. When the body was done, I proceeded to make a little pot for the cactus to sit in, with wheels attached to it for movement. Lastly, I used the subdivision tool to make the cactus boss smoother, I also used the brush tool in the sculpting session to create some small thorns to add to the feeling that the boss was a cactus. When the model was done and all group members approved of the character, the next step is to rigg and animate the boss in a similar way that is described in session #9.
