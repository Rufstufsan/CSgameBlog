Today the group was gathered to make some progress on the game since the progress has been very slow and almost non existing for about a week. During the meeting, we came up with some milestones for the session. We all wanted to set the goal of having a playable level at the end of the meeting. A playable level included that the player should be able to complete some tasks to make progress in the game and when all the tasks are completed, a boss will spawn that the player has to kill to complete the level. We decided to include this in our game so that there is a clear goal for the player in each level.
