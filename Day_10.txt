For today's meeting, we decided that the main character should not be a priority since the game will be a first-person shooter I had already started to create a running animation for the main character, but it had to be discarded for the game. Instead, we decided that I should focus on creating a boss character and its movements. Firstly we decided on doing a boss that looks like a grass straw, this boss would not have any movements besides rotations, so I only had to create the model in Maya.  The shape was very simple and I almost spend no time creating this boss since I thought that it was boring that I couldn't animate it, and also the shape of the character was boring so I didn't want to spend much time on it. I tried to give some input that I wanted to make something else instead but I had no success in changing their mind. I just did a rough 3D model for the boss and then exported it for the unity team to implement into the game.
