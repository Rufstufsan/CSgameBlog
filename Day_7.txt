In this session I decided to create the main character for the game. Firstly one of the team members created a rough sketch of the main character that I refined into a reference sheet to make it easier to make a 3D model from it. I decided to create a 3D reference sheet since it's much easier to follow a reference than it is to create a character from imagination. To import the reference sheet into Maya I had to go into the desired view panel (for example front view) and then choose view -> Image Plane -> Import image. Then I selected my reference sheet for the front view. The same process would be applied to the side view as well. When the reference images were imported into Maya I could start the 3D modeling process. The modeling process was pretty much straight forward and I managed to complete the model. The next step is to rig the character and animate it.
