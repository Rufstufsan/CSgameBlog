In this session, I wanted to export the cactus boss into unity and give it some texture. I did this by creating some materials, I did one material for the caucus boss when it was aggressive, this turned out to be a metallic gray color that would symbolize metallic since the boss is a robot from the beginning. Then I created a green cactus color that was for when the boss was defeated, then the boss would return to its natural appearance once again and reunite with the world. The pot and the wheels were just a simple brown and black color respectively. Now the game starts to come together properly and since the deadline I around the corner I have worked a bit with the GDD.
