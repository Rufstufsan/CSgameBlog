In this session, I decided to create a simple idle animation for the main character. This was fairly easy since it's just some small movements for the character. The idle animation will make it look like the character is just standing still and breathing. Firstly I put the character in its starting position and put a keyframe for the first and last frame. I did this since I want the animation to be looping, and for some smooth transitions for a looping animation, the first and last frames must be very similar to not make funky movements when the animation starts over. When that was done, I proceed to go to the frame in the middle of the animation to make the character take a breath, this can be done by lifting up the shoulders slightly and tilting the head slightly backward. When I put the keyframes in the middle of the animation there will be an automatic process in Maya where the movement from one keyframe to another is calculated. Often it's just from one translation to the next, but this can be modified in the animation window. But when there are only two keyframes the movement always looks mechanical and not very organic, to fix this I place some more keyframes along the way, making some smooth transitions. When I was happy with the animation I exported the character as an FBX file. This file format stores the animations that are created as well as textures if there are any.
