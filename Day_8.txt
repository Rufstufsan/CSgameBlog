Today I continued to work on the main character and its animations. Firstly I placed out a skeleton for the main character so that the mesh could be modified smoothly. This will make the animation process possible in the future. When the skeleton was placed I wanted to create controllers for the skeleton that makes the animation process easier. This is because with a controller I don't need to move every individual joint in the skeleton. After all, the controller makes smooth transitions automatically by just moving the controller. But before I attached the controller to the skeleton I had to create some IK-handles[2] to attach to the legs and arms on my 3D model. This is a tool that helps with leg and arm movement since the joints will bend in a straight line when moving them around. I also had to attach an IK-handle spline to my character to make a spine so that my character can use its upper body. Then I was satisfied with the skeleton and its functionalities I could proceed to attach the controllers to the skeleton to finally complete the rigg. Now when the rigg is done, the next step would be to actually animate the character and then export it for further use in Unity.
