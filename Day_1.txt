Today we assembled the group and got to know each other, we discussed our individual skills and what we are aiming to do. We set up our work environment and did some brainstorming. We decided that we wanted to create a 3D survival game, where the main character is to survive for as long as possible while monsters spawn in waves trying to kill the main character. Our UPS for the game was to transform an industrial environment into a natural environment filled with plants and colors.
