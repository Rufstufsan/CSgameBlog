23/3

Today we assambled the group and got to know eachothers, we discussed our individual skills and what we are aiming to do. We set up our work envionment and did some brainstorming. We managed to decide that we wanted to create a 3D survival game, where the main character is to survive for as long as posible while monsters spawn in waves trying to kill the main character. We also decided that our ups for the game was to transfom an industrial envionment into a natural environment filled with plants and colors.
