Summary:
The game development was very funny, I have some previous experience with 3D graphics since I studied game graphics in the gymnasium. There I tried out 3D modeling and animation in Maya, and also how to implement them into Unity so that was very fun. I wish I had more time to put work into this game design since I like the idea and I like the aesthetics, but because of other courses that need to be passed, I didn't prioritize the game as much as I would want to. I also think I made some mistakes and wasted some time when creating the main character since the game was to be a first-person shooter so the user would never be able to see the main character. In the future, I would do the planning more in-depth before proceeding to do the 3D models. Overall I'm very happy with the game and the teamwork that we had in the group. Sometimes it was hard to assemble the group here on campus, but I think that it worked out fine.
