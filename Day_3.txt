During this session, I managed to 3D model and roughly texture om of the enemy creatures. Firstly I downloaded a reference sheet of a rat, then I started the modeling process. After a while, I remembered that the enemies should have an artificial/industrial appearance so I had to start over. I began by placing out simple shapes of the body, such as cylinders, spheres, and cubes, and then proceeded to connect the simple shapes to form a body, legs, and tail. I wanted the body to appear metallic so I used a phong material for now but in the Unity engine there are materials for metallic objects. My next task to complete this enemy is to rig the body and then make some basic animations for it. The 3D object is already shared with the rest of the team for them to give feedback on the model.
