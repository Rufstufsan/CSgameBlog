During this session i managed to 3D model and roughly texture om of the enemy creatures. Firstly i downloaded a reference sheet of a rat, then i started the modelling process. After a while i remembered that the enemies should have an artificial/industial appearence so i had to star over. I begun by placing out simple shapes of the body, such as cylindes, spheres and kubes, and then proceeded to connecting the simple shapes to form a body, legs and the tail. I wanted the body to appear metallic so i used a phong material for now but in unity engine there are materials for metalic objects. My next task to complete this enemy is to rig the body and then make some basic animations for it. The 3D object is already shared with the rest of the team for them to give feedback on the model.
